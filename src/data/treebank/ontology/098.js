  uniqueInsight: {
    title: "The Simplicity of True Religion",
    insight: "This surah contains one of the clearest definitions of 'deen' in the Quran. After all the debates between religious groups, Allah says the essence is simple: (1) Worship Allah alone (2) With sincerity (3) As hunafa (pure monotheists) (4) Establish prayer (5) Give zakah. That's it - 'wa dhaalika deen al-qayyimah' (and that is the correct religion). The complexity and divisions came from human additions, not from divine command. Notice that verses 6-7 use 'sharr al-bariyyah' and 'khayr al-bariyyah' (worst and best of CREATION) - this includes all created beings. Those who reject clear truth fall below animals in rank, while believers rise above all creation.",
    modernRelevance: "When religion seems complicated or divided, return to this simple formula. Sincerity + prayer + zakah = the true religion. Divisions come when people add to or subtract from this core."
