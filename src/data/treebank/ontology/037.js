  historicalContext: {
    note: { en: "This Makkan surah addresses the polytheistic beliefs of Quraysh who considered angels to be Allah's daughters (a claim they found acceptable while despising daughters for themselves), and who claimed kinship between Allah and jinn. The surah was revealed during a period of intense persecution, offering comfort through prophet stories - all faced rejection but were ultimately honored. Ibrahim's sacrifice narrative here is the most detailed in the Quran and forms the basis of Eid al-Adha traditions. The debate over whether the sacrificed son was Ismail or Ishaq is noted by scholars, with the majority view being Ismail based on the context (Ishaq is announced separately in verse 112).", ur: "This Makkan surah addresses the polytheistic beliefs of Quraysh who considered angels to be Allah's daughters (a claim they found acceptable while despising daughters for themselves), and who claimed kinship between Allah and jinn.
